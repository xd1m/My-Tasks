## Lab 02 Reflection

### üìå What did you observe or question during this assignment?

I learned how to structure a full front-end project with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I had some questions about layout sizing (like image size), but resolved them using HTML.

### ‚è±Ô∏è How long did it take? How long did you expect it to take?

It took around [4 hours].  
I expected it to take less, but when i have working step by step and doing some search, it helped me a lot.
